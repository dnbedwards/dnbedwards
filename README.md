# Hi there, I'm Duncan Edwards

I'm a solutions architect and software engineer living Sydney, Australia. I have a passion for solving problems with technology in the medical and financial sectors.

# Experience

- **Big Picture Medical - Chief Software Architect, Chief Technology Officer, Lead Engineer** - _November 2014-Now_ - Joined as the first employee of a medical technology startup based in Sydney Australia. Big Picture is a cloud-based Diagnostic Support and Interconnectivity product with users in UK, USA and Japan. The company now has an engineering team of more than 30 people after Series A funding and a number of high value global customers. My role was to build the product from the ground up, lead technical teams and grow the business with the founder and CEO.
- **Indx Guru - Chief Software Architect** - _November 2014-September 2018_ - Indx Guru is a cloud-based market data and analysis tool that analyses metrics and fundamentals of publicly listed companies in Australia and presents them in a simple format for private investors. My role was to focus on solution design and build backend features of the product with the talented development team. Following my deparature, Indx Guru pivotted to a B2B model and no longer has a public-facing product.
- **Macquarie Group - Graduate, Technical Analyst, Development Lead** - _February 2012-November 2014_ - My first job out of university, I worked for the largest investment bank in Australia. My role was in the development team of Macquarie Private Wealth (Now Macquarie Wealth Management), which is the retail financial advice business. 
- **University of New South Wales - BEng (Electrical Engineering)/BSc (Computer Science)** - Like most others, I didn't know what I wanted to be coming out of High School but knew that I enjoyed solving technical problems. I found a passion for physics and computing early at university and ended up focussing on both disciplines. I achieved a High Distinction average (over 85%) in each semester with four dean's awards. My final year's focus was on Digital Signal Processing and I achieved First Class Honours with my thesis titled "Robust Methods for Separating Video into Foreground and Background Regions"
